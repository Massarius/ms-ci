# Environments

The current directory hold the effective configurations for Production and Development environments, called **prod** and **env**, respectively.

Additionally, other environments are also being tested. These are `minimal-prod` and `minimal-prod-module`. 

These last two environments were created due to configuration issues generated by the previous environments. Both of these are currently being tested, replicating the minimal configuration provided in: [source 1](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/create-environments#gcloud_1) and [source 2](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/terraform-create-environments).

These is the state of the current repositories, updated in date 19/8/2022:
